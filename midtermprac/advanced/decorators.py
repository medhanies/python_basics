"""
A function decorator is a design pattern that allows the ability to add
functionality to an existing function.
As an example assume we have a protected function (a function that only a limited
group of users can call), before the function is executed we should check whether
the caller is authorized to call the function or not. Let's also assume that the caller
is expected to send their username as the first argument when they call the function.
For this purpose we will create an Authorize decorator that, before calling the funtion,
checks on whether the caller is authorized or not.
