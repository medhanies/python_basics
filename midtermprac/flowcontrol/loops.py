# Loops
# Conditional control whether a code block should execute or not.
# Loops control how many times a code block should execute
# '''

# # for loop
# for x in range(11):  # range is a built-in function (widely used in for loops) that returns an array from 0 to the number provided to the function as argument
#     print(x)  # in every iteration x will be assigned a value from 0 to 10

# # loop over list contents using the in keyword
# fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(f'Yummy! a {fruit}')

# while loop
# a while look accepts a condition and will continue to loop over its code block
# as long as the condition evalues to true
# i = 10
# while i >= 0:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1  # this is shorthand for i = i + 1

# # DANGER: be careful not to write infinite loops with while (i.e., a while loop where the condition never evaluates to false)

'''
The continue keyword with loops:
'''
# # use continue to skip an iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Example:
# for i in range(5):
#     # range returns a list that starts with 0 and ends with arg -1 (i.e., range(5) -> [0,1,2,3,4])
#     if i == 1:
#         i -= 1
#         continue  # the continue keyword will skip the iteration when i == 1
#     print(i)  # this will print 0, 2, 3, 4

# # continue with while loop (this works for similarly to for loop):
# i = 5
# while i >= 0:
#     if i == 1:
#         i -= 1
#         # continue
#     print(i)
#     i -= 1

'''
The break keyword with loops:
'''
# # the break keyword forces a loop to termiante before completeing the full iterations
# for i in range(5):
#     if i == 4:
#         break  # this will termniate the loop immediately
#     print(i)  # this will print 0,1,2,3

# break works the same way with while loop:
# i = 5
# while i >= 0:
#     if i == 0:
#         break
#     print(i)  # this will print 5,4,3,2,1
#     i -= 1

# '''
# The else keyword with loops:
# '''
# # you can also add an else block to a for/while loop. The code in the else block will execute after the loop terminates:
# i = 5
# while i >= 0:
#     print(i)
#     i -= 1
# else:
#     print('the loop terminated successfully!')

# # else works the same with for loops
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)
# else:
#     print('the loop terminated successfully')


# # NOTE: the else code block does not run if the for/while loop was terminated using the break keyword
# i = 5
# while i >= 0:
#     if i == 4:
#         break
#     print(i)
#     i -= 1
# else:
#     print('This line will not print because the loop termianted abruptly with the break keywords')

# # NOTE: the else code block will work as expected with the continue keyword. Else will execute once at the end of the loop
for i in range(5):
    if i == 4:
        # i -= 1
        continue
    print(i)
    # i -= 1
else:
    print('this line will run once after the loop terminates successfully')


# i = 2
# while i >= 0:
#     if i == 1:
#         i-=1
#         continue
#     print(i)
#     i-=1
# else:
#     print('...')
